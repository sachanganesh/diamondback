**It should be noted that parsimony trees are not the state-of-the-art method used for phylogenetic tree construction. In fact, they are generally not preferred.**

Please install required python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Use `python parsimony.py -h` to run the program and see the available options.

Subtree pruning and regrafting, tree bisection and reconnection, as well as a histogram of parsimony scores are included in this project.
